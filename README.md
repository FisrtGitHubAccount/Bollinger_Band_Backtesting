# Bollinger Band Backtesting

Bollinger bands are calculated by taking the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) of a stock price (for the most part) and then calculating the upper and lower bounds as the SMA +- two standard deviations of the actual stock price. Buy/Sale signals are spotted when the price crosses the Boilinger bands.

**This project is currently undergoing.**
